I have spent much of my career developing new technologies for satellites, VR, and quantum devices. Communicating what is so exciting about tech is my passion, and I love building new demos and tools to help enable the open source community to grow 🌱

#### When not at the keyboard you can find me:
- ⚠ laser cutting everything (safe),
- 🛥️ floating somewhere out on Puget Sound,
- 📚 writing [books](https://www.sckaiser.com/books/), and 
- 🐕 playing with my pup, Chewie.
